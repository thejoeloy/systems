# Systems Programming
This repo contains a variety of the core systems programs and utilities that go into a computer system. The goal is to implement simple versions of all of the useful hardware and software components that go into a computer. The implementations will
focus on open source components with licenses that encourage privacy, freedom, and collobaration. Namely, hardware components will target the RISC-V architecture, and the software components will target Unix like systems such as Linux and BSD.

## Components

### Hardware

CPU:

Cache:

Memory Management Unit:

### Software

Heap Allocator:

Shell:

Filesystem:

I/O:

Networking:
